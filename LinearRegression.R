# (a) State, in a clear and precise way, the problem that you will be solving in this assignment.

# The goal of this assignment is to fit the best possible linear model 
# and to study the effects of 8 explanatory variables on one response variable, price

###### Data Importation #####
# import data
kc_houses <- read.csv("kc_house_data.csv")
dim(kc_houses)
str(kc_houses)

##### Data Preprocessing #####

#' Our decisions on choosing the predictor variables are on interest, interpretability,
#' and the correlation analysis done

# 1. price - Price of each home sold
# 2. X bedrooms - Number of bedrooms
# 3. X bathrooms - Number of bathrooms, where .5 accounts for a room with a toilet but no shower
# 4. sqft_living - Square footage of the apartments interior living space
# 5. X sqft_lot - Square footage of the land space
# 6. X floors - Number of floors
# 7. waterfront - A dummy variable for whether the apartment was overlooking the waterfront or not
# 8. X view - An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was
# 9. X condition - An index from 1 to 5 on the condition of the apartment,
# 10. grade - An index from 1 to 13, where 1-3 falls short of building construction and design, 7 has an average level of construction and design, and 11-13 have a high quality level of construction and design.
# 11. X sqft_above - The square footage of the interior housing space that is above ground level
# 12. X sqft_basement - The square footage of the interior housing space that is below ground level
# 13. yr_built - The year the house was initially built
# 14. yr_renovated - The year of the houseâ€™s last renovation
# 15. X zipcode - What zipcode area the house is in
# 16. lat - Lattitude
# 17. long - Longitude
# 18. sqft_living15 - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
# 19. X sqft_lot15 - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors

# Hence I will eliminate these columns for now, and proceed

#' The coefficients (from multiple regressions) are usually called 'adjusted effects' 
#' when there is more than a variable and, as such, the equation has been adjusted for 
#' other predictive variables of interest. In this example, we use the adjusted coefficients
#' of model_4. The interpretation of, for instance, grade6 is that, in average, price
#' varies 100 x ($e^{0.098268}$-1) = 10.33% between the reference category (grade5) 
#' and the comparison category, grade6, after adjusting for the remaining explanatory 
#' variables. This explanation holds for every coefficient of grade.

#' The values of fit in both instances can now be compared. By taking their ratio,

#' The 95% confidence interval, as seen by this effect, is calculated with the same
#' type of calculations for the ratio [100 * (exp(12.88982)/exp(12.70643)-1),100 * 
#' (exp(12.90217)/exp(12.73487)-1)] = [18.21%,20.12%].

# (e.4) interpret the effect induced by an increase of two standard deviations in X1

# To answear this question, the standardized coefficients must be calculated.

model_4_std # standardized coefficients from model_4

#' In model_4, price (response) and sqft_living are both log transformed, thus will 
#' cause some changes in interpretation. The unstandardized coefficient of 
#' log(sqft_living) in model_4 means that a aproximately 1%  of change in 
#' sqft_living will induce a change of around 0.47% in price, adjusting for the 
#' remaning explanatory variables. When the data is scaled prior to regression, 
#' a change of 1 standard deviation in log(sqft_living) is equivalent to 0.3788 
#' standard deviations in the mean of log(price), and therefore a change of 
#' 2 standard deviations will affect the mean of log(price) by 0.7576 standard deviations,
#'  adjusting for the remaining explanatory variables.


# (e.5) study the existence of a statistical significant interaction between X1 and X2. Independently from its
# statistical significance, interpret those interaction effects.

#' model_4 was changed to include this interaction, along with their base predictors, 
#' thus creating model_4_interaction.

#' The very low coefficients (and standardized coefficients) of this model suggests there 
#' is not a prevalent interaction between these variables. Independently from this 
#' conclusion, the interpretation is that, for instance, in the interaction 
#' log(sqft_living):grade6, the effect of log(sqft_living) on log(price) will increase
#'  by approximately 0.061% from grade5 to grade6, after adjusting for the remaining 
#'  explanatory variables. This holds for the rest of the interactions. 
#'  As another example, in the interaction log(sqft_living):grade13, means that the 
#'  effect of log(sqft_living) on log(price) will increase by approximately 0.64% 
#'  from grade5 to grade13, after adjusting for the remaining explanatory variables.
